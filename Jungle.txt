 You have wandered into a Wet and Dangerous Jungle; 
as your Dino

{name}
wanders through the Jungle, you feel a rumbling....
THUMP.... THUMP...... THUMP!
you quickly hide under cliff overhang covered with foliage.
oh no....

its a big Tyrannosaurus (stregth 50) !!!!
and it saw you run into the overhang.

What gene additions will you choose using CRISPR:
1. insert a gene from the golden poison frog that allows your dino to produce Batrachotoxin (BTX) making it poisonous to the touch.
2. edit genes to produce greater amounts of vitamin D for stronger bones (plus 5 strength).
3. insert a gene from sea coral that allows your Dino to glow red in light.
4. insert a gene that allows the Dinosaurs skin to be translucent.
(to pick an option please type a number 1 to 4):
