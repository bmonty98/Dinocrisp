has reached the humid, and stinky Swamp.

this area is full of disease especially with regards to masquitos that carry the malaria virus.
if your dino gets bitten and contracts this virus it will surely parish.

what Gene modification would you like add to ur dino using CRISPR:
1. edit genes in order for your Dinosaur to produce Oval-shaped blood cells (this is what allows camels to be efficient with water).
2. insert genes that allow your dino's immune system to emmulate one of a Bat; which makes it immune to many different types of illnesses.
3. insert a gene from sea coral that allows your Dino to glow red in light.
4. insert a gene that allows the Dinosaurs skin to be translucent.
(to pick an option please type a number 1 to 4):
