 Welcome
to the HOT & DRY Desert.
Your dinosaur just drank the last water left in its watering hole.
Without water

{name}
will surely die; and the next watering hole is miles away.
What gene additions will you choose using CRISPR:
1. edit genes in order for your Dinosaur to produce Oval-shaped blood cells (this is what allows camels to be efficient with water).
2. edit genes to produce greater amounts of vitamin D for stronger bones (plus 5 strength).
3. insert a gene from sea coral that allows your Dino to glow red in light.
4. insert a gene that allows the Dinosaurs skin to be translucent.
