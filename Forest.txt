Welcome to the spooky forest full of luscious greenery.
you run into a wild Snake (has strength of 4)!!!!

what Gene modification would you like add to ur dino using CRISPR:
1. edit genes in order for your Dinosaur to produce Oval-shaped blood cells (this is what allows camels to be efficient with water).
2. edit genes to produce greater amounts of vitamin D for stronger bones (plus 5 strength).
3. insert a gene from sea coral that allows your Dino to glow red in light.
4. Insert a gene from a Ichthyosaur that turns your Dino warm - blooded and allow it to produce blubber and retain heat better.
(to pick an option please type a number 1 to 4):
