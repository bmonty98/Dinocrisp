what Gene modification would you like add to ur dino using CRISPR:
1. edit genes in order for your Dinosaur to produce Oval-shaped blood cells (this is what allows camels to be efficient with water).
2. insert genes that allow your dino's immune system to emmulate one of a Bat; which makes it immune to many different types of illnesses.
3. insert a gene from sea coral that allows your Dino to glow red in light.
4. insert a gene that allows the Dinosaurs skin to be translucent.
