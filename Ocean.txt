has reached a very deep and large Ocean full of sealife.

your dino must cross it in order to get to its species mating grounds located in the great plains.

what Gene modification would you like add to ur dino using CRISPR:
1. edit genes in order for your Dinosaur to produce Oval-shaped blood cells (this is what allows camels to be efficient with water).
2. insert genes from a Crocodile that allow ample muscle growth to its tail in order to make it useful for swimming.
3. insert a gene from sea coral that allows your Dino to glow red in light.
4. insert a gene that allows the Dinosaurs skin to be translucent.
